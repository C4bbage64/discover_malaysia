## Map Features
- [ ] **General Address Search (Geocoding)**
    - *Idea:* Allow users to search for any address in Malaysia (e.g., specific streets, restaurants) even if they are not in our curated destination list.
    - *Implementation:* Use a geocoding API (OpenStreetMap Nominatim or Google Places) to translate text queries to coordinates. Move the map to that location.
    - *Note:* These results will likely not have "Details" pages since they are outside our database.
